Here’s a role description you can include in your DevOps engineer resume:

Project Role Description:

As a DevOps Engineer, I was responsible for automating and streamlining operations and processes. I collaborated closely with development and IT teams to enhance continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. My role involved managing cloud infrastructure, monitoring system performance, and ensuring high availability and scalability. I implemented infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform and Ansible, and I played a key role in containerization using Docker and Kubernetes. Additionally, I was involved in setting up and maintaining version control systems, automating testing, and managing configuration management tools. My contributions significantly reduced deployment times, improved system reliability, and enabled rapid response to production issues.

You can customize this description based on the specific tools and technologies you used in your projects.
