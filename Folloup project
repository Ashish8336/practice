Subject: Request for Release from Current Project – Follow-Up

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to follow up on my request for a release from the Jaguar and Land Rover project. I appreciate the time and consideration you’ve given to this matter.

As mentioned, my current project activities, which aligned with my skill set, have been successfully completed. At this time, there are no further requirements in the project that match my expertise. Remaining idle is not beneficial for the organization or for my professional growth. I believe that transitioning to a project that better aligns with my skills will allow me to contribute more effectively and continue developing my career within the company.

I have discussed this with my manager, Shripad Sathe, who has kindly approved my release. I understand that the client’s approval is also an important factor, and I am hopeful that they will understand my position and support this transition as well.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth and seamless handover of my responsibilities and am ready to assist in any way required during this transition. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to take on new challenges and contribute to a project where my skills can be fully utilized and further developed.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this matter. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Rushikesh Arun Wale
